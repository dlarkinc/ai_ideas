Several personalized learning assistant (PLA) software solutions are being adopted by universities to enhance student learning and provide individualized support. Below are some notable examples:

### 1. **ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI**
   - Many universities are experimenting with tools like **ChatGPT** as personalized learning assistants. These generative AI tools provide on-demand answers to student questions, help brainstorm essay topics, and offer coding assistance.
   - Some institutions have integrated these models into their learning management systems (LMS) to create a more interactive learning environment, where students can get immediate help with concepts taught in class.

### 2. **Jill Watson by Georgia Tech**
   - **Jill Watson**, an AI teaching assistant, was developed using IBM's Watson technology and has been used at **Georgia Institute of Technology**. Initially deployed in an online computer science course, Jill Watson assists students by answering common questions related to the course material and assignments.
   - It provides responses within seconds, helping ease the burden on human teaching assistants and offering a consistent support channel for students.

### 3. **IBM Watson Tutor**
   - IBM Watson has been integrated into several university courses to act as a **personalized tutor**. It assists students by analyzing their answers to questions and suggesting tailored reading materials and exercises.
   - For instance, **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)** has partnered with IBM to use Watson to deliver a personalized learning experience in various STEM subjects, providing insights into areas where students might need further practice.

### 4. **Microsoft Azure AI and AI Builder for LMS Integration**
   - Universities have integrated **Azure AI services** with their LMS to provide personalized support to students. For example, **Cornell University** and others are leveraging Azure’s AI services to build chatbots that answer student queries, provide learning resources, and facilitate learning schedules.
   - The **AI Builder** feature allows universities to automate content recommendations based on individual progress and preferences, creating a dynamic, adaptive learning experience for students.

### 5. **Hubert.ai**
   - **Hubert.ai** is an AI assistant used to facilitate student feedback and engagement, helping educators adapt course material to meet student needs. It provides automated feedback analysis by engaging students in natural language conversations about their learning experience.
   - Universities like **Stockholm University** use Hubert.ai to create a personalized support environment, allowing instructors to gauge student understanding and modify their teaching approaches accordingly.

### 6. **Edsight**
   - **Edsight** is an AI-driven platform used at some universities to offer personalized tutoring for students. It combines machine learning algorithms with generative AI to provide a highly customized study path based on students' learning history and preferences.
   - The platform tracks student performance and identifies areas of improvement, generating quizzes, exercises, and study materials in real time.

### 7. **Socratic by Google**
   - **Socratic** is being used by university students as a mobile-based AI learning assistant. Socratic helps students understand difficult concepts by using visual explanations and AI-generated answers.
   - While originally popular with high school students, Socratic has been adopted by university students seeking support in STEM subjects, offering another layer of personalized support outside the classroom.

### 8. **ALEKS by McGraw-Hill Education**
   - **ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces)** uses AI to assess what students know, identify gaps, and provide individualized content recommendations to fill those gaps. It’s used in various universities to support math and science courses.
   - The system adapts in real time based on student responses, ensuring that each student has a tailored path through the material that adapts to their unique strengths and weaknesses.

### 9. **Moodle with AI Plugins**
   - Some universities are using AI-enhanced versions of **Moodle**, an open-source LMS. Through integrations with AI plugins, Moodle can offer personalized feedback, automated tutoring, and interactive study guides.
   - **MyPAL**, a Moodle plugin, is designed to act as a personalized learning assistant that offers tailored activities and resources based on an individual learner's progress within the course.

### 10. **Cognigy.AI in Virtual Campus Assistants**
   - Universities are also deploying conversational AI tools like **Cognigy.AI** to create virtual campus assistants that help students navigate learning resources. This kind of AI serves as a personalized guide, answering queries related to academic schedules, courses, or campus resources.
   - **University of Duisburg-Essen** in Germany implemented Cognigy to assist students with both academic and administrative queries, enhancing their overall university experience.

### 11. **Quizlet AI and Chat-Based Assistants**
   - Tools like **Quizlet** have introduced AI-driven features that help students study more effectively by generating custom quizzes and flashcards based on the material they need to review. 
   - These generative AI-based study tools are being utilized by university students to create personalized study sessions, which helps them reinforce their learning outside of formal instruction.

These tools, either developed in-house or through partnerships with tech companies, enable universities to provide more personalized, accessible, and engaging support for students. By integrating generative AI in different aspects of teaching and learning, universities aim to enhance the educational experience and address individual learner needs in more dynamic and scalable ways.
